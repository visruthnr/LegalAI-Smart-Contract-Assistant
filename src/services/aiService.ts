üö® **High Risk Clauses:**
- Late payment fees (5% daily compound interest)
- Unlimited tenant liability for repairs
- Vague security deposit return terms

‚ö†Ô∏è **Medium Risk Areas:**
- 60-day termination notice requirement
- Landlord's right to enter with 24-hour notice

**Recommendation:** I suggest negotiating the late fee structure and clarifying maintenance responsibilities. Would you like me to help you draft alternative language for any of these clauses?`;
  }

  if (lowerMessage.includes('late') || lowerMessage.includes('fee')) {
    return `The late fee clause in your lease is particularly concerning. Here's what it means:

**Original clause:** "Late payment shall incur a fee of 5% of the monthly rent for each day the payment remains outstanding after the fifth day of the month."

**Translation:** If your rent is $2,500/month and you're 10 days late, you'd owe:
- Day 6: $125 fee
- Day 7: $125 fee  
- Day 8: $125 fee
- And so on...

This could add up to $1,250 in just 10 days! 

**Better alternative:** "Late fees are $50 after a 5-day grace period, capped at $200 total per month."

Would you like me to generate more tenant-friendly alternatives?`;

  if (lowerMessage.includes('termination') || lowerMessage.includes('end') || lowerMessage.includes('break')) {
    return `Regarding lease termination, here's what your document says:

**Early Termination:** You can terminate early with 60 days written notice, but you'll pay a penalty equal to 2 months' rent ($5,000).

**Normal Termination:** Either party can end the lease with 60 days notice at the end of the lease term.

**Your Rights as a ${userRole}:**
- You can negotiate the penalty amount
- Some states limit early termination fees
- Job relocation might qualify you for reduced penalties

**Scenarios where this matters:**
- Job change requiring relocation
- Family emergencies
- Property becoming uninhabitable

Would you like me to simulate a conversation about early termination with your landlord?`;

  if (lowerMessage.includes('maintenance') || lowerMessage.includes('repair')) {
    return `The maintenance clause in your lease heavily favors the landlord. Here's the breakdown:

**What the lease says:** "Tenant agrees to maintain the premises in good condition and shall be responsible for all repairs and maintenance, ordinary and extraordinary."

**What this means for you:**
- You pay for ALL repairs, even major ones like HVAC, plumbing, electrical
- Normal wear and tear becomes your responsibility
- Structural issues could be your financial burden

**Standard practice:** Landlords typically handle:
- Major appliance repairs
- Structural maintenance  
- HVAC system maintenance
- Plumbing beyond minor clogs

**Red flag:** "Extraordinary" repairs could include roof, foundation, or electrical system issues costing thousands.

**Recommended rewrite:** "Tenant responsible for minor maintenance under $100. Landlord handles major repairs, appliances, and structural issues."

This could save you thousands in unexpected repair costs!`;

  if (lowerMessage.includes('security') || lowerMessage.includes('deposit')) {

**Current terms:** $5,000 deposit with vague language about "faithful performance" and "damages."

**Problems with this:**
- No timeline specified for return
- Unclear what constitutes "damages"
- No process for dispute resolution

**What could happen:**
- Deposit held for months after move-out
- Deductions for normal wear and tear
- No itemized list of damages

**Better language:** 
"Security deposit of $5,000 refundable within 21 days of move-out. Deductions only for damages beyond normal wear and tear, with itemized receipt provided."

**Your state laws:** Most states require deposit return within 14-30 days with itemized deductions.

Would you like me to check what's typical for security deposits in your area?`;
  }

  if (lowerMessage.includes('negotiate') || lowerMessage.includes('change')) {
    return `Here are negotiation strategies based on your role as a ${userRole}:

**High-Priority Items to Negotiate:**
1. **Late fees:** Reduce from 5% daily to flat $50 after grace period
2. **Maintenance:** Limit tenant responsibility to items under $100
3. **Security deposit:** Add timeline for return (21 days)
4. **Termination penalty:** Reduce from 2 months to 1 month rent

**Your Negotiating Position:**
- Good credit score and stable income
- Long-term tenant potential
- Market conditions (if favorable to tenants)

**Scripts for negotiation:**
- "I'm very interested in this property, but the late fee structure seems unusually high compared to other leases I've seen..."
- "Could we add language about the security deposit return timeline to protect both of us?"

**Alternative approach:** Propose a lease amendment with your preferred terms.

Would you like me to help draft specific negotiation points or alternative clause language?`;
